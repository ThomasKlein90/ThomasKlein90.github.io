                    <h4>Count your reps</h4>
                    <p>Fitness training generates data in many different ways. From measuring your heart rate or number
                        of steps, to estimating the number of calories expended
                        or the power generated or something simpler as the number of repetitions, sets or the weights
                        lifted, there are many ways of generating, measuring and
                        analyzing data about your body and its performance while exercising. Many instruments and
                        gadgets have capitalize on this, giving you access live to
                        this data and some apps and websited now even build and train model to provide their users with
                        a customized, tailor-made workout plan.
                        There is no denying it: fitness workouts are a numbers game.

                    <br>

                    <h4>The LesMills BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> fitness program</h4>
                    <p>LesMills is a company, originally from New Zealand, designing various types of fitness programs
                        (cardio, HIIT, strength, yoga, etc.)
                        taught by instructors in gyms all over the world in the form of group classes.
                        BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> is one of those programs. Usually in a 55mn class
                        format, it focuses on low-weights/high-repetitions workouts, using a light barbell and some
                        weight plates to develop, reinforce and tone all
                        of the main muscle groups of the body (legs, back, chest, arms, shoulders, core). What makes it
                        special? The workout is divided in 10 tracks (including
                        a warm-up and a cool-down) of 5-6mn each where the participants follow a choregraphy synced to
                        music. The choregraphy involves a variety of moves
                        working the muscles in different ways and tempos making the exercise more varied and less
                        repetitive. The music along with the instructor make the
                        workouts more engaging. Finally, every 3 months, the design team of LesMills licenses 10 new
                        music tracks and designs a brand new set of moves and
                        combinations and releases it to the licensed instructors accross the world so they can learn
                        these new choregraphies before bringing them to their
                        members in their regularly scheduled classes. This helps to keep the program fresh while keeping
                        a certain level of standards.
                    </p>

                    <h4>My personal LesMills BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> journey</h4>
                    <p>I first walked in a LesMills class about 10 years ago, in 2015, while visiting friends in
                        Belgium. They brought me to their BODYATTACK<sup>™</sup> class
                        another program of the same group, this one focusing HIIT cardio. I struggled to even finish the
                        class... But I was hooked. Coming back home, I
                        looked for a gym teaching LesMills program and immediately started joining
                        BODYATTACK<sup>™</sup>, BODYCOMBAT<sup>™</sup> (another cardio class,
                        inspired by martial arts moves) and BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> classes. Fast forward to 2021, after
                        moving to Hong Kong and looking for a new personal
                        challenge I decided to become a BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> instructor, passing the certification
                        program (involving an initial training, a mentoring
                        program and a final exam). Since then I've been teaching classes at gyms in Hong Kong and now
                        have 3 weekly regular classes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Data and project motivation</h4>
                    <p>As mentioned before, there is a lot of interesting data generated around fitness in general and
                        the BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> program. I could be writing about
                        heart rate, fitness level, the weights used, etc. Instead I chose to focus on the program
                        itself. See, with 10 new tracks being released every 3
                        months, LesMills does a good job at keeping the program consistent as well as keeping it fresh,
                        evolving and up to the latest trends. And not only,
                        is it 10 new songs but also 10 new choregraphies. Now, once again the structure does not change,
                        and so track 2 is always going to be squats, track 5
                        biceps etc., and there are only so many different moves and ways to train a muscle group with
                        weights. Still, I (and most instructors would confirm)
                        and the feeling that some releases (ie. set of tracks released every quarter) felt harder or
                        easier that others. This could be due to the tempo of the
                        song being faster or slower, the frequency or just number of repetitions, or the intrinsic
                        difficulty of the moves and combos in the choregraphies.
                        Therefore, the project goal is about capturing and trying to objectify as much as possible
                        differences in levels of difficulty between releases.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>The project goal is about capturing and trying to objectify as much as possible

                    <h4>Source of data: the BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> choregraphy notes</h4>
                    <div class="grid-container-2-1">
                        <div class="grid-item-2-1">
                            <p>I went looking for datasets on BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> tracks, trying to obtain a neatly
                                organized
                                set of moves, repetitions (reps) and timings for as
                                many tracks as possible but could not find any. I was going to have to create by own. As
                                an
                                instructor, you have to purchase your own music released
                                and licensed by LesMills on a platform to be able to use it in your classes. The songs
                                also come
                                with choregraphy notes, teaching the instructors all
                                they need to know about the sequnce, moves, timings (or tempos), number of repetitions
                                and
                                combinations (or combos). These documents generally follow
                                the same format (though not always) meaning it would be possible to capture and extract
                                data
                                from them and store them in a tabular format.

                    <h6>Methods</h6>
                    <p>The first part of the <a href="https://github.com/ThomasKlein90/BodyPump/blob/main/bodypump_full.ipynb
                        target=" _blank">Jupyter Notebook</a> available on the GitHub repository linked above focuses
                        on
                        doing just that. Using 19 different choregraphy notes
                        (from releases ranging from #94 to #127), I wrote functions reading the pdf documents
                        page by
                        page
                        and pulling out only the information about the
                        choregraphies (there are also notes and comments addressed to the instructors). More
                        specifically, I
                        set out to extract for each track:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the metadata about the track: release number, track title, track number, muscle
                            group, track
                            duration;</li>
                        <li>for each move in the track: move description, number of repetitions, tempo, time
                            index.</li>
                    </ul>
                    As some of the files or tracks have specificities, I also had to take into account a lot of
                    special
                    cases as well as ssometimes outright correct the data
                    that was captured by my code (hence the long block of manual modifications in my notebook).
                    Additional work required calculating the number of repetitions when these were in
                    combinations,
                    and renaming the moves to a consistent, fixed list of possibilities to allow for comparison.
                    Finally, I arrived at a table like the one below.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/article_bodypump/Bodypump_choregraphy_notes_translated_example.jpg"
                        alt="description" height="150" />

                    <h4>Adding personal information</h4>
                    <p>While the data obtained above enables an objective comparison between tracks, I was also
                        interested to add some personal touches.
                        <br>
                        First, I added my own intensity ratings to be able to
                        compare tracks having different moves. Taking the triceps tracks for example, the issue
                        is how
                        to compare a track that has mostly triceps extensions with a bar or a plate, with one
                        that
                        has mostly kickbacks or one that is a mix of triceps pushups and dips? It is just not
                        possible.
                        Now, while the intensity ratings are obviously a personal perception and classification
                        of intensity, they do allow for such comparisons. On the repository, the file
                        <a href="https://github.com/ThomasKlein90/BodyPump/blob/main/move_intensity_assignment_v1.csv"
                            target="_blank">'move_intensity_assignment_v1.csv'</a> shows the values chosen
                        between 0 (lowest intensity) to 100 (highest). For example a triceps dip with a 2/2
                        tempo has an
                        intensity of 50, while a triceps pushup 1/1 gets a rating of 70 and a triceps press 4/4
                        gets just 25.
                        <br>
                        Second, I keep track of the list of songs I teach in every class. I call such lists
                        'mixes' as I mix tracks from different release to create the
                        playlist for a certain class. Combining this with a system of track IDs, I am able to
                        join such data with the data mentioned before to calculate
                        intensity for my different mixes and compare them.
                        <br>
                        Third, I usually wear (and remember to start...) a sports watch while teaching my
                        classes. I was able to access my fitness data captured by Polar
                        and, using the workout dates of my different mixes on one side, and of the training sessions on
                        the side, cross join fitness data
                        measurements to the mixes data described above. Training load, maximum and average heart rate
                        are therefore able to be used in
                        conjunction with the repetitions and intensity data of the corresponding tracks and workout
                        sessions calculated before.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Results and dashboard presentation</h4>
                    <p>After compiling the data and generating csv files to use as datasources, I was able to present
                        the results of my findings as a Tableau dashboard.

                    <p>This first sheet (broken down in two for ease of read) compares tracks accross 4
                        different simple
                        metrics, overall, and within each muscle group:</p>
                    <h5>01- Track overall comparison</h5>
                    <div class="grid-container-2-1">
                        <div class="grid-item-2-1">
                            <p></p><ul>
                                <li>Track duration: just the longest and shortest tracks overall and per muscle group.
                                    Most
                                    tracks average 5 minutes but the longest one I
                                    have access to is the 6:27 long back track from release #124 "Won't Make A Sound".
                                </li>
                                <li>Number of reps: the total count of reps (included, but indicated separately, pulses)
                                    in each
                                    track. It's not rare for a whole Bodypump workout to
                                    total 1000 reps. The lunges track from release #117 "I Want It" is 216 reps, largely
                                    due to
                                    the high number of pulses (192), reps of lower range.
                                </li>
                                <li>Track speed: this metric is calculated by dividing the length of the track (in
                                    seconds) by
                                    the number of reps. This means that tracks with a high
                                    track speed have a lot of reps comparatively to the length of the track. I found
                                    this metric
                                    interesting as some track may be have more reps than
                                    others but eventually have the same number of reps or even lower, making them "less
                                    intense". For example, the biceps track of release #95 "GDFR"
                                    is only 4:25. But it has 154 reps in that time, making it actually the "fastest"
                                    biceps
                                    track with 1.72 sec per rep (or 1 rep every 1.72 sec).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Track intensity: this more complex metric sums the individual perceived intensity
                                    score I
                                    gave to each move for all the moves in one track and
                                    divides the total by the song duration in seconds. That way, we get an estimation of
                                    the
                                    load of the track, while factoring its duration, making this
                                    metric even more complete than the previous one. Actually, 4 of the 5 hardest tracks
                                    identified with the previous metrics are still showing up here,
                                    but for example, because on average I find moves in shoulders tracks harder (and
                                    especially
                                    the ones in this track), the shoulders track from
                                    release #98 "Tribes" surges to rank #4 of the hardest tracks overall.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <h5>02- Track metrics analysis</h5>
                    <p>
                        This second sheet lets the user compare tracks, either by track type or by release, according to
                        the metrics described before. By default, the metric chosen is the track intensity per second,
                        but others can be selected.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Per Track Type: based on this metric, we can see than Lunges and triceps have the highest
                            intensity. Most Bodypump instructors or
                            members would confirm that! The top right scatter plot shows that Chest and Lunges tracks
                            have actually the highest number of reps,
                            though lunges track being usually a bit shorter, it makes them more intense.
                        </li>
                        <li>Per BodyPump release: the comparison of the average for this metric is more difficult, but
                            overall it sometimes feel like most tracks
                            from specific release felt harder. Bodypump #96, #117 and #118 seem to be in that case. On
                            the right we can see that Bodypump #116, the
                            one I have actually passed my certification on and I consider as one of the "easiest", has
                            tracks generally shorter and with fewer reps.
                        </li>
                        <li>All tracks: the bottom two scatterplots are showing all the tracks in the dataset and are
                            therefore better used by mousing over some of
                            the outlier data points. I also wanted to confront my own perception of the difficulty
                            (rating out of 10) to the actually calculated
                            intensity as described before. The correlation is not obvious but there is a slight positive
                            correlation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>03- Moves analysis</h5>
                    <p>
                        This third sheet goes down to the actual moves breakdown. Over all the releases, the BodyPump
                        choregraphies include many variations of the
                        same "move". A standing triceps extension is not exactly the same as a sitting one, a wide
                        pushup engages chest muscles a bit differently
                        compared to a mid-grip one. However, for the sake of comparison, I've combined and grouped some
                        of the moves under a fixed list of
                        move types.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall: this chart shows the top 10 most popular move types. Unsurprisingly, these are the
                            usual suspects: squats, chest presses, pushups,
                            lunges, deadrows... These moves are colored on the rest of the page, meaning that the
                            non-colored ones (in grey) are moves outside of this
                            "top 10".
                        </li>
                        <li>Per track type: the goal of this selectable histogram is to show on average, how many reps
                            of each move types are done. We can see for example that
                            the most popular move in the triceps track is the triceps overhead extension (~39 reps in a
                            track), with triceps kickback and triceps press close
                            behind. Chest tracks mostly consist in chest presses and pushups and biceps tracks of biceps
                            curls. Shoulders tracks are more diverse in moves,
                            sometimes including strict presses, sometimes involving pushups and upright rows, sometimes
                            using side raises.
                        </li>
                        <li>Per BodyPump release: here I was interested in showing the distribution of these popular
                            moves per release. If we look at release #108 (see below),
                            we see that while the Squat and Lunges tracks are very "conventional" with mostly just
                            squats and lunges, the triceps track is more "original" than
                            the average one, using triceps pushups and triceps kickbacks for two thirds of the reps. The
                            shoulders track also involves deltoid fly for half of it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>04- Make your own mix</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this sheet I wanted to showcase my dashboard building skills by bringing some interaction
                        with the user. If you are an instructor and you want
                        to use it to build your own mix of tracks for your next class, he is how I intended it:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select the metric you want to focus on for the track selection. Maybe you want to maximize
                            (or minimize) intensity. Or the number of reps.
                            Select this at the top.</li>
                        <li>For each track type, a bar chart displays the list of available tracks, ordered by the
                            metric you selected. You can select a track for each track type,
                            using the drop downs and it will highlight it in orange.</li>
                        <li>Once you've selected all your tracks, an indicator on the right confirms it and shows for
                            how many of them the data about the reps is available.</li>
                        <li>The next multiple bar chart gives an overview of the tracks selected, with 3 different
                            metrics for each track. You can select and change the metrics displayed.</li>
                        <li>Finally, the last part shows the brekdown of the moves, both per track and the overall
                            total.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h5>05- My mixes analysis</h5>
                    <p>This last worksheet brings in the fitness data measured by my Polar watch like I mentioned it
                        before. I'm focusing here on a metric called "Cardio Load"
                        which is an aggregated score calculated by Polar for each workout session (based on duration,
                        average and max heart rate, and time spent in the 5
                        different cardio zones). I wanted to see if there is a correlation between higher cardio loads
                        and the metrics discussed before to "objectivize"
                        the difficulty of the songs and mixes. I am comparing the cardio load (y-axis) to my own
                        perceived subjective difficulty rating (out of 10, first x-axis),
                        the average intensity per second per song (second x-axis) and the average number of reps per
                        track (third x-axis). The scatter plots do not really
                        show any obvious correlation though a faint upward trend can be observed. But for example, the
                        "hardest" training session, on 2024/07/20, only scores a 5.0
                        on my subjective difficulty ranking and is also on the lower end for the intensity metric. In
                        the upper half of intense workouts, the one with most reps
                        had a total of over 1000 reps!
                        <br>These observations obviously need to be tempered by the fact many other factors can
                        influence the heart rate and cardio load measured. The watch
                        itself, not as accurate as other devices, the form of the day, how much sleep I had the night
                        before, the weight on the bar... Consider this more as a
                        thought exercise than a real consluive analysis!
                    </p>
