                    <h4>Count your reps</h4>
                    <p>Fitness training generates data in many different ways. From measuring your heart rate or number of steps, to estimating the number of calories expended 
                        or the power generated or something simpler as the number of repetitions, sets or the weights lifted, there are many ways of generating, measuring and
                        analyzing data about your body and its performance while exercising. Many instruments and gadgets have capitalize on this, giving you access live to
                        this data and some apps and websited now even build and train model to provide their users with a customized, tailor-made workout plan. 
                        There is no denying it: fitness workouts are a numbers game.

                    <h4>The LesMills BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> fitness program</h4>
                    <p>LesMills is a company, originally from New Zealand, designing various types of fitness programs (cardio, HIIT, strength, yoga, etc.) 
                        taught by instructors in gyms all over the world in the form of group classes. BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> is one of those programs. Usually in a 55mn class 
                        format, it focuses on low-weights/high-repetitions workouts, using a light barbell and some weight plates to develop, reinforce and tone all 
                        of the main muscle groups of the body (legs, back, chest, arms, shoulders, core). What makes it special? The workout is divided in 10 tracks (including
                        a warm-up and a cool-down) of 5-6mn each where the participants follow a choregraphy synced to music. The choregraphy involves a variety of moves 
                        working the muscles in different ways and tempos making the exercise more varied and less repetitive. The music along with the instructor make the 
                        workouts more engaging. Finally, every 3 months, the design team of LesMills licenses 10 new music tracks and designs a brand new set of moves and
                        combinations and releases it to the licensed instructors accross the world so they can learn these new choregraphies before bringing them to their 
                        members in their regularly scheduled classes. This helps to bring the program fresh while keeping a certain level of standards.

                    <h4>My personal LesMills BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> journey</h4>
                    <p>I first walked in a LesMills class about 10 years ago, in 2015, while visiting friends in Belgium. They brought me to their BODYATTACK<sup>™</sup> class 
                        another program of the same group, this one focusing HIIT cardio. I struggled to even finish the class... But I was hooked. Coming back home, I 
                        looked for a gym teaching LesMills program and immediately started joining BODYATTACK<sup>™</sup>, BODYCOMBAT<sup>™</sup> (another cardio class, 
                        inspired by martial arts moves) and BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> classes. Fast forward to 2021, after moving to Hong Kong and looking for a new personal 
                        challenge I decided to become a BODYPUMP<sup>™</sup> instructor, passing the certification program (involving an initial training, a mentoring 
                        program and a final exam). Since then I've been teaching classes at gyms in Hong Kong and now have 3 weekly regular classes.
