                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Another one of my hobby is climbing. Indoor or outdoor, bouldering or sport climbing (with a
                        rope), I fell in love with the sport in 2020. The fact that
                        it combines physicality and balance with mental qualities such as determination and figuring out
                        a problem (not to mention creativity) makes it a
                        very complete and a very exciting discipline. So it is not really surprising that I also got
                        into professional climbing competitions, which got a
                        relatively increased hype and popularity over the past few years, especially since its
                        introduction in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and due to the rise
                        of "superstar" Janja Garnbret. But climbing is a difficult sport to judge and rank due to its
                        "all-or-nothing" nature (after all, either you reach the
                        top or you don't). It is also one of those sports where athletes are competing versus each other
                        to a certain extent, but mostly against the walls
                        and the people who design the bouldering problems and lead climbing routes (called
                        route-setters). This post dives into the topic of professional
                        climbing competions and scoring.

                    <h4>Project</h4>
                    <p>I set out for two main objectives with this project and the exploration of climbing competitions
                        results. The complete Jupyter Notebook can be
                        accessed <a href=https://github.com/ThomasKlein90/IFSC/blob/main/IFSC.ipynb
                            target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In anticipation for the 2024 Paris Olympics and its climbing event, I wanted to use a
                            "ranker" model to see if I could predict the results
                            based on historical results at various competitions on the circuit.
                        </li>
                        <li>As the scoring rules have evoled between the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2024 Paris one, I
                            wanted to recalculate what the results
                            could have been at that competition if the new rules had been applied back then.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>1. Predicting Paris 2024</h4>
                    <p>IFSC, the international federation of sport climbing, has a continuous circuit of competitions
                        throughout the year, similar to ATP and WTA for tennis.
                        At each of these events in many different locations, climbers compete through a
                        qualifications/semi-finals/finals format. After gathering the results
                        of major and minor climbing competitions since the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 to the start of 2024,
                        I set out to use a ranker model (XGBRanker) to focus on prediciting the order of the contestants
                        at a future competition. The methodology
                        only relies on comparing pairwise the most common order in which contestants finished to predict
                        what is the most likely order when presented with a
                        set of entries. I submitted on 9 of the most popular (and likely) contestants to have a shot at
                        the win in Paris and obtained the predicted ranking below.</p>
                    <img src="images/article_IFSC/ifsc_predicted_paris.jpg" alt="description" height="250" />
                    <br><b>Edit:</b> when I originally did this analysis, the 2024 hadn't happened yet. Now the results
                    are here and obviously my model not predicting Janja
                    Garnbret to win was always going to be wrong. Brooke Raboutou did finish second, and Jessica Pilz
                    third similar to the model's prediction. Miho Nonaka and
                    Natalia Grossman actually failed to qualify for the final, while Ai Mori finished 4th and Chaehyun
                    Seo 6th. "Surprised" Erin McNeice and Oceana
                    McKenziw finished 5th and 7th while Oriane Bertone, predicted first my the model, crumbled under the
                    pressure in the finals and finished in 8th.
<br>
                    <h4>2. Revisiting the past: what Tokyo 2020 could have been</h4>
                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p>In its first introduction to the Olympics in 2020, climbing took the form of a triple event.
                        Speed climbing, bouldering and lead climbing formed part
                        of a single classification to determine medal, with the rankings at each one of the three events
                        simply being multiplied together to give the final
                        order. This came with a lot of criticism from fans (and athletes), mostly because speed climbing
                        relies on completely different qualities compared to
                        the other two events. The total ranking method was also questionable as someone doing vastly
                        better at say, bouldering, but slightly inferior at
                        speed would be penalized.
                        <br>For the 2024 edition, speed climbing was separated from the other two and given its own
                        event and medals. We will not focus on it for this
                        analysis. Bouldering and Lead remained combined, with event having a possible maximum 100 points
                        to score, then both scored tallied up to give the
                        final ranking. Now I will go slightly more into details about the calculation of these scores as
                        it was the whole point of this study.

                    <h6>Bouldering scoring</h6>
                    The bouldering event at the 2024 Olympics was scored as follows: 4 boulder "problems", each one
                    awarding a maximum of 25 points for completing it
                    (for a maximum total of 100 points). Not reaching the top but reaching intermediate "zones" is also
                    rewarded, with the lower zone awardin 5 points, and the higher one 10.
                    Finally, each subsequent tentative and restart (in the imparted time) deducts 0.1 points (mostly to
                    separate ex aequo).
                    <br>Back in Tokto 2020, the was no point system since all that mattered was the ranking. Athletes
                    were separated first my the number of tops (finishing the problem), then
                    the number of zones (there was just one intermediate zone, halfway through each problem), and
                    finally the number of attempts. The score would look something like
                    "2T3z 5 3" which mean 2 tops, 3 zones, 5 top attempts, 3 zone attempts (over 3 boulders).
                    <br>It is difficult to compare the score between 2020 and 2024 but I've chosen the following
                    assumptions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>to transpose the scores to a scale of 0-100, each boulder will be worth 25 points (for the
                            qualifications, 4 problems) or 33 points (for the
                            finals, 3 problems)
                        </li>
                        <li>there was only one zone in Tokyo, for which I decided to award 40% of the points (so 10 in
                            the qualifications, 13 in the finals).
                            A value of 30% would also make sense</li>
                        <li>like the current rule, 0.1 points would be deducted by attempt</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Lead climbing scoring</h6>
                    The lead event is slightly more straightforward to score. There is only one route and one attempt to
                    climb it, the first fall being definitive and we
                    then take the highest point the climber reached as their final score. The scoring method now (and in
                    Paris 2024) consists in awarding a total of 100 points
                    as well, spread out over the top 40 holds a climber has to use to reach the top. The last 10 holds
                    award 4 points each, the 10 before that 3 each, etc.
                    <br>Again, in Tokyo, athletes were only compared and ranked based on how high they got. We know the
                    number of moves they completed so we can apply the same
                    scale, calculating the number of moves to reach the top, and then giving 4 points for each of the
                    holds used in the 10 below that, then 3, then 2, then 1.

                    <h5>Results and comparison</h5>
                    After applying those calculations to re-estimate the score the athletes would have gotten in Tokyo
                    if the assu and methods described above had been applied,
                    we can compare their final score and position to the one they actually got. Note that we are
                    discarding the speed climbing event in our adjusted calculation
                    as we want to just estimate the rank they would have obtained if it had just been a separate Boulder
                    & Lead competition, like in Paris 2024.

                            <p>The qualifications, in which the athletes need to place in the top 8 to proceed, would
                                have been quite impacted. For men, Bassa Mawem,
                                a speed specialist qualified in 7th while if only boulder and lead had mattered he would
                                have been last... Alex Megos, a German climber,
                                could have had a shot at a medal but in Tokyo setting, only placed 9th in
                                qualifications. Finally, Gines Lopez, future gold medalist,
                                would have barely made the cut to the finals if only Boulder and Lead counted.

                                qualifications, greatly owe their ticket for the finals to
                                their speed performance. Shauna Coxsey, a famous, veteran climber form the UK, narrowly
                                missed on the finals but would have made it if it
                                was just Boulder & Lead. The more balanced (and generally stronger) climbers that are

                                But his poorer performance in bouldering would have meant he would have only finished
                                5th with Paris 2024 rules. Austrian Jakob Schubert would

                            <p>Finally, for the women finals, nothing would have changed the complete domination of
                                Janja Garnbret. But the podium would have looked very
                                different with Pilz and Seo finishing 2nd and 3rd instead of 7th and 8th if their poor
                                speed climbing performance didn't matter.

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>There are a few obvious flaws with an analysis like this one. First, the rules were what they
                        were in Tokyo and it meant that all climbers trained
                        for all 3 events, not just two. Still, most people agree that the qualities needed for Boulder
                        and Lead are closer and make more sense to group together
                        these events than the Speed one. The point system and the two zones were also not in place in
                        Tokyo, making the calculations and projections I made
                        highly contestable. Finally, the words I used on the charts above such as "robbed" are just
                        there to attract attention to the results of the comparison,
                        I do not mean that anyone did not deserve their final ranking in Tokyo!
